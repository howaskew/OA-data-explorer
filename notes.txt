Notes from Nick on the integration of DQ / validation and test suite:

If anyone’s interested in seeing the existing data quality checks in action, check out this thread:
https://github.com/openactive/data-catalogs/pull/31
Points of note as follows:
The validator has a set of data quality rules baked into it (search “data quality” in https://validator.openactive.io/about)
Those validator rules are run by the test suite in CI and a validation report is produced with examples of the issues (report attached)
James has looked at the report and identified the cause of the issues (missing addresses in a couple of venues)
He’s now correcting the issues so that it can pass CI
As mentioned previously, one could imagine other data quality metrics being included at the top of the attached validation report, which currently only focusses on required fields
